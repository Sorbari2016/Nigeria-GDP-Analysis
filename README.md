# Analysis and Visualisation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Nigeria (2020 - 2024)

## Introduction 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period of time (usually a year). It's often used as a broad indicator of a country's economic health and growth. 
This analysis examines Nigeria's GDP from 2020 to 2024, offering a detailed overview of its performance throughout this period.

## Objectives 
- Analyze Quarterly GDP Trends: Look at how Nigeria’s GDP changed from the first quarter of 2020 to the last quarter of 2023. Pay attention to major shifts and trends in both the actual and adjusted GDP numbers. Also, review how different sectors and industries performed during this time.
- Assess Quarterly Growth Rates: Calculate and explain how Nigeria’s GDP grew from one quarter to the next and compare it to the same quarter of the previous year to understand how the economy is moving.
- Highlight Key Metrics: Focus on important figures, like real GDP, the percentage change from the last quarter, and the percentage change from the same time last year. This will help paint a clear picture of how the economy is doing.
- Visualize Data for Clarity: Use Excel and Power BI to present the GDP data in an easy-to-understand way. Create line charts to show the GDP trends over time and bar charts to highlight the percentage changes in real GDP compared to past years.
